# HelguX - A New, Very Good Kernel (Coming in 2028)

Welcome to HelguX, an ambitious kernel project in the works, aiming to be fast, optimized, modular, and secure. I am not just building another kernel — this is a vision to create something different.


The plan is simple: make a kernel that works, performs well, and pushes boundaries. You can follow along as this evolves. 



# Goals with HelguX
Be good – Uh huh.

Performance-focused – Most likely not with the programming skills I got LMAO.

Modular – Yeah sure.

Secure – Maybe with your help, or in V2

Native support for Linux and Windows apps – Probably not, but good to dream big!


# Project Roadmap

2025: Early development and research phase. Setting the groundwork for a solid kernel base.

2027: Initial kernel version for testing. Aiming for basic stability and performance.

2028: Full-feature release. Expect major improvements, optimizations, and modularity by then.

2030: Helgux V2 -  Because who doesn’t love a sequel?
